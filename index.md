## Description
*The problem:* Students typically limit themselves to only studying consistent locations when there are hundreds of available study spots all over campus. Sinclair or Hamilton library are the “go-to” study spots, but both can get busy throughout the week and especially during finals week. There are many spots available to students that are not utilized because students are not aware of it.

*The solution:* A website that will allow students to post and rate study spots throughout the UH Manoa campus and the surrounding areas so that other students become aware of possible study spots. The entry for each location will list hours, capabilities, capacity of the location, and accessibility to different types of students. In addition, there is a “real-time” feature, where students can login and provide time-stamped notifications about the current state of the study space. This can inform other students about whether the space is noisy, or crowded, or even quiet and empty.

## Cram Connect Goal
To provide a intuitive user interface that can provide an efficient system to allow students to discover and rate study spots in and around the UH Manoa campus.

The system should eventually provide a sign-in system that allows the user to edit their preferences, filter out study spaces to find an appealing location, and receive real time notifications about the current state of study spaces. After the initial development of our website, we hope to add additional features to Cram Connect, including maps information about study spaces and a news feed of the latest updates on users' favorite locations.
